# Kickstarting with Excel
---
## Overview of Project
Data-driven decisions pave the way for success. In this project, quatitative analysis of Kickstarter campaigns is conducted to help Louise reach her play _Fever_ fundraising goal and define the best strategy to achieve it. The analysis illustrates the results of outcomes based on launch date and goals, describes challenges faced, and introduces conclusions and data limitations.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to perform analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends and insights related to plays in kickstarter campaigns.  

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis included 1369 Theater campaigns in 21 countries. Theater campaigns outcomes' analysis revealed that the highest nymber of successful campaigns was for those launched in May then June. Slicing down to the subcategory of plays, analysis of outcomes based on goal showed that highest percentage(76%)of success was for campaigns with goal range less than 1000$. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The graph shows the Theater outcomes for each month. Successful campaigns peak in May (111) and hit its lowest value in December (37).  Failed campaigns tend to have a flat peak with close results for May, June, July, and August. Canceled campaigns show uniform low results over the year except for October which zero canceled campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The graph shows the _Plays_ outcomes vs goal range. The highest percentage of successful campaigns was 76% for the goal range of 1000$ or less. The lowest percentage of successful campaignes was 0% for the goal range 45,000 to 49,999$. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The dataset for plays campaigns has significant number of outliers that may have skewed the results. Although grouping goals into ranges enhanced visibility to results, the trend generated was sufficient to explain success or failure rate based solely on goal.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The success rate trend is generally 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
